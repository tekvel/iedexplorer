========================  IEDExplorer ========================


The IEDExplorer project has been created in my free time in order to learn the IEC61850 protocol.
The result is the only (as I have seen over Internet) pure .net managed MMS stack (not complete yet)
and a very basic IEC61850 MMS client implementation.

The code is NOT in production quality, written by a non-professional programmer:
- it completely lacks tests
- it uses Binary Notes implementation of MMS ASN.1 encoding/decoding, which is relatively
  slow in the C# flavour, thus not really suitable for a serious usage
- it has a simplistic UI and UI bindings (needs some refactoring)
- IEC61850 is modelled in a very simple manner, and model is incomplete (refactoring needed)
- the MMS client side only has been implemented

On the other side:
- it works (at least for me on some test setups)
- it has already helped me in some situations in debugging 61850 communications
- it has a big potential for improvement
- it can be a free alternative to some commercial test utilities
- it runs under Windows and under Linux/Mono

The project is looking for enthusiastic programmers who want to explore the mysterious
world of IEC61850 protocol.

Rev 0.78 experimental SCLServer release 2016/04/23
This release is an experimental release with a new feature:
IEC61850 SERVER representing data from a loaded SCL file = SCL Server
SCL Server uses libiec61850.dll and its .net extension libiec61850dotnet.dll
Both libraries are embedded in the .exe
How to use the feature:
Load a valid SCL file.
SCL Server can be run by a right-click on the IED name in the SCL tree view, select Run SCLServer
Values in the SCL Server can be changed manually only a.t.m. - right click in the SCL View Window
Changed values should be visible for all connected IEC61850 clients via reads and reporting.
GOOSE messaging and sampled values are not implemented.

SCLServer is in ALPHA experimental state!!!
SCLServer may be separated into an independent exe in the future!!!

Shortened commit review:
* SCLParserDOM2.cs - new review of SCL paresr
* SCL server enhancements, debugging - writing values
* Editing values in SCL Server model.
* Inclusive reporting with configured TrgOps.
* Tcp - disconnect recogniition
* SCLServer - initial values
* SCLView - changing values (manually)

Service release 0.79h 2019/10/08
* Mireks contribution:
* I've created InnoSetup project to create Setup.exe. For that reason I've added to project file INNO_SETUP define for contitional compilation.
Logger.cs and MainWindow.cs are affected.
This changes also alows to start multiple instances of IEDExplorer I've replaced tmpFile with random filename and IniFiles I've moved to LocalUserAppDataPath,
but this is only active with INNO_SETUP defined in project file

Scsm_MMS.cs:  Added parsing of structured data (i.e. Tr, Str) in ReportView.

OctetString can't be stored as object(string) because of following error:
  byte[] bin = { 0x58, 0x1f, 0x61, 0x5d, 0xc6, 0,0,0 };
  object DataValue = System.Text.ASCIIEncoding.ASCII.GetString(bin);
  byte[] bout = System.Text.ASCIIEncoding.ASCII.GetBytes((String)DataValue);
  bin != bout

for byte octet values > 0x7F after conversion with GetString and reverse GetBytes values are not properly converted.
I've changed to storing octetstring as byte[].
NodeData.StringValue and NodeRCB.EntryID properties are modified. I have tested this for EntryID.
EditValue dialog is also changed to fit this problem.
